# Dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed through [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

Stuff included in this repo:
* vim & nvim
* zsh
* tmux
* i3
* polybar
* termite
* rofi
* cli-vis
* misc shell scripts

Stuff I use that doesn't have anything in here:
* Gummi

Things I have yet to do with my configs, but am planning on doing so:
* I need to switch from xfce4-notifyd to dunst later
* I need to get termite to properly set its window title (does tmux interfere?)
